# Web Page Functionality Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates an interactive web page that includes draggable elements, dynamic table rows, and undo/redo functionality. The webpage allows users to interact with a table, add or remove rows, and perform drag-and-drop operations between cells. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on creating a responsive and engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Interactive Table**: A 3x3 grid of draggable elements that users can interact with.
- **Dynamic Row Management**: Add or remove rows while adhering to a maximum and minimum row limit.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Track and revert changes to the table using undo and redo buttons or keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z for undo, Ctrl+Y for redo).
- **Floating Animated Elements**: Decorative, animated elements that float in the background to enhance the visual appeal.
- **Randomized Colors**: Draggable elements have dynamic, randomly generated colors.
- **Reset Functionality**: Restore the table to its initial state with a click of a button.
